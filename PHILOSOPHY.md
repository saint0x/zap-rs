## Overview

The core **philosophy** behind our router is to build a **highly performant**, **scalable**, and **extensible** solution that allows us to deliver top-tier performance in API routing without compromising flexibility. We aim to combine **Rust's low-level performance** with the **ease of TypeScript integration** through NAPI, creating a powerful tool for developers that can be easily integrated into their existing systems.

This document will explain why and how we are building this router, focusing on **performance**, **creativity**, and **empowerment**.

## 1. **Performance First**

### **Why Performance?**

- **Rust is the key to performance**: We are using **Rust** because of its **performance benefits**, particularly with its **low-level memory control**, **zero-cost abstractions**, and **concurrency** features. This router will deliver extremely fast response times, even under heavy load, because we **optimize memory** usage and ensure low-latency routing.
- **Memory Efficiency**: One of Rust's strongest traits is its memory management. By focusing on **zero-copy operations**, we minimize the need for expensive memory allocations, making this router fast, scalable, and highly efficient in real-world scenarios.
- **Concurrency**: Rust's async features, combined with **Tokio**, enable us to handle a high number of simultaneous requests without sacrificing speed. We will design this router to support **high concurrency** from the ground up, allowing it to scale without bottlenecks.
  
### **Performance Features**
- **Zero-Copy Processing**: The router will process requests with minimal memory allocations to ensure lightning-fast response times.
- **Trie-based Route Matching**: This allows us to perform routing decisions in **O(1)** time, ensuring that path matching, even for complex patterns, is done in constant time.
- **Async Handling**: We will implement the server with async handling to process requests concurrently, which enables it to handle high throughput and concurrency without blocking.

## 2. **Empowerment and Flexibility**

### **Empowerment Through Extensibility**

The router's design is based on the idea of **empowering developers** to modify, extend, and adapt the router to their specific use cases without compromising performance. We will achieve this through a combination of:

1. **Hooks for Customization**:
   - Developers will have the ability to **hook into the request processing** at various stages (e.g., before routing, before/after middleware, error handling) to customize behavior.
   - These hooks will give them **full control** over things like request validation, logging, authorization, and even error handling, all while maintaining the router's performance.

2. **Middleware Support**:
   - The router will support a **middleware system** that runs before and after route handling. This system will be designed to support asynchronous middleware, allowing developers to integrate authentication, logging, validation, or any other custom logic.

### **Creativity in Development**

- **No Opinionated Code**: While we provide a solid foundation with the router's core features, we won't force developers to follow rigid patterns. They should be able to implement their API routing with the utmost flexibility, guided by the performance of the Rust backend.
- **Type Safety with TypeScript**: When the router is integrated with TypeScript via NAPI, we’ll offer a **type-safe experience** that helps developers write secure, bug-free code. Rust’s type system allows us to define robust, expressive types that prevent many common bugs, while TypeScript will ensure the integration is as smooth as possible.

## 3. **Design Principles**

### **Simplicity and Clarity**
- **Minimalist Approach**: We are focused on simplicity in the architecture. We avoid unnecessary complexity and ensure that everything has a clear purpose.
- **Clear Abstractions**: The router will expose a minimal but powerful API to developers. The abstractions should be **easy to understand** and **easy to use**, avoiding unnecessary layers of complexity.
- **Minimal Configuration**: We aim to provide **default behavior** that works well for most cases while also allowing the user to configure and extend as needed.

### **Modularity**
- **Scalable Design**: We will modularize features like routing, middleware, error handling, and response transformation so they can be easily swapped out or extended.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Different parts of the router (e.g., routing, error handling, middleware) will be cleanly separated, ensuring that we follow the **principle of least surprise** for developers.

---

## 4. **What We Want to Avoid**

### **Premature Optimization**
- While performance is a priority, we won’t sacrifice **developer experience** for the sake of optimization. We will first build a clean and modular core, and then optimize areas that need improvement based on profiling.
  
### **Too Many Dependencies**
- We aim to **minimize dependencies** to keep the router lightweight and easy to maintain. We’ll only add libraries when they genuinely help us achieve our goals (e.g., `hyper` for HTTP, `tokio` for async).

### **Overengineering**
- We will avoid building solutions to problems that don’t exist yet. The router will focus on solving the most **important and common needs** of API routing, and we will build only the features that **developers really need**.

---

## 5. **The Ultimate Goal**

The ultimate goal of this router is to provide developers with a tool that gives them **unmatched performance** without compromising **flexibility**, **creativity**, or **empowerment**. We want developers to feel like they have full control over their API routing logic while **working with the best performance** possible.

By providing hooks, middleware, and **type-safe bindings** to TypeScript, we aim to ensure that developers have **everything they need** to build high-performance APIs that are easy to scale, maintain, and extend.

## Conclusion

The router we are building is **built for the future**. It is designed to be **highly performant**, **extensible**, and **developer-friendly**. We focus on the core principles of **simplicity**, **performance**, and **empowerment**, all while making sure the architecture is **modular** and **scalable**.

With this router, we will help developers achieve the highest levels of performance in their applications while giving them the **freedom to innovate** and **customize** their API routing logic to meet their needs.
